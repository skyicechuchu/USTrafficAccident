# US Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization

## Description

Traffic accidents are a major cause of fatalities and severe injuries in the U.S. leading to significant economic impact and posing a key public safety challenge. Our project uses a large dataset to create three main components: 

1. Historical Accident Dashboard 
2. Severe Accidents Probability Heatmap
3. Real-Time Accidents Severity Predictions

We used a combination of one linear and two non-linear machine learning models, applying various feature engineering and overfitting reduction techniques to achieve high prediction accuracy. The project is designed as a web application with interactive visualizations, enabling users to draw insights from historical data and assess the risk of severe traffic accidents in real time.

## Installation

No additional packages are required for this application. It is fully implemented on PythonAnywhere and can be accessed directly through a web browser.

## Execution

### How to Run the Flask Application

To use the application:

1. Run the `flask_app.py` using Python or open "Flask APP.ipynb" in Jupyter notebook.
2. The default flask server should be `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this link in an incognito window for the best results.
3. Enter a valid zip code into the provided field.
4. The application will generate a prediction based on live weather data.
